  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">Your Personal Information is Important</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We are required to comply with all applicable privacy laws and data collection laws, in all countries we operate in,
    including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles, (“Privacy Laws”)
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">Collecting Personal Information</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Privacy Laws generally regulate the collection and use of “personal information”, which includes information or an
    opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.</p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We collect personal information by various means (including, but not limited to, when you fill in a form, send us an
    e-mail, enter a competition, order our products, speak to one of our representatives or deal with one of our
    affiliates, business partners, advertising partners, customers and other third parties). We generally collect
    personal information directly from you where this is reasonable and practical, but we may also collect personal
    information from third parties.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    This information may include (but is not limited to) your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, contact numbers, date
    of birth, bank account and credit card details. We also collect information obtained as a result of reference,
    criminal or credit checks that you authorise us to carry out.

  <p class="mb-4">
    Other than in relation to people who directly work with or for us, we do not generally collect the following
    categories of sensitive information: information about your race or ethnic background, religion, trade union
    membership, political opinion, sexual preference or criminal record. We may collect health information about you
    from time to time. We will only collect sensitive information (including health information) with your prior
    consent.

  <p class="mb-4">
    We may also collect more information about how you interact with our websites and mobile applications, including

    usage information, in order to help us to develop and improve our websites and mobile applications.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you provide us with certain services, for example as a contractor or consultant, we may collect your personal
    information and, in some circumstances, sensitive information. Examples of where we collect this information include
    carrying out safety inductions, where we require you to provide driving records or medical certificates and if we
    carry out criminal record checks.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you provide personal information to us about someone else, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that
    information to us. For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the
    various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy and has consented to the collection, use and disclosure of their
    personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

  <p class="mb-4">
    Cookies are small pieces of text stored by your web browser. Our websites and mobile sites use cookies to connect
    you and the information you have provided in order to deliver to you personalised content and a better experience
    when you return to the website or mobile site. Most internet browsers automatically accept cookies, although you can

  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">Accuracy and Security of Personal Information</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We take reasonable steps to secure any personal information which we hold about you and to keep this information
    accurate and up-to-date. Personal information is stored either electronically or in hard copy and information
    security measures are in place to protect this information.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Our website does not provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the internet. Users should
    be aware that there are inherent risks transmitting information across the internet.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    We will take such steps that are reasonable in the circumstances (if any) to destroy or de-identify personal
    information when it is no longer required for the purpose(s) it was provided.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">Data Breach Notification</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Many countries and their Privacy Laws have or are starting to establish data breach reporting regimes. We
    acknowledge the introduction of a mandatory data breach notification scheme which commenced in Australia on 22
    February 2018. Where the Australian regime applies, in the event of an ‘eligible data breach’, the Office of the
    Australian Information Commission and any affected or at-risk individuals will be promptly notified when we have
    reasonable grounds to believe that there has been unauthorised access or disclosure of personal information, or that
    the information has been lost in a way that is likely to give rise to unauthorised access or disclosure. Generally
    speaking, we are only required to make a notification where there is a likely risk of serious harm, as a result of
    the unauthorised access or disclosure or where we have not been able to take sufficient remedial action before any
    serious harm results.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If we notify you of a breach, where possible we will provide recommendations as to the steps you should take
    regarding the breach.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">Access to or correction of personal information</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    You may request access or changes to your personal information held by us. To do this, please contact us through our
    Privacy Officer by sending an e-mail to us at privacy@example.com or call us on the numbers below. Any change
    relating to credit eligibility information or credit information must be submitted in writing to
    finance.credit.maintenance@example.com.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    There may be situations where we are not required to provide you with access to your personal information, such as
    where the request relates to an existing or anticipated legal proceeding or if your request is vexatious.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-lg uppercase font-bold mb-2">What to do if ou have a complaint or a question?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you would like further information about how we manage your personal information, have any queries or feedback
